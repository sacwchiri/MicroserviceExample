#NOTES
There are many things left to do
* Connect to user login flow
* bug fixes on query limits
* security
* add front end with view
* build shell script to make life easier (love me some make files <3)
* sortBy is broken
* this microservice style is over kill for an app this size
* cool story bro

# Install
* on a Linux machine (although it may work on windows by changing the data path)
* download docker and docker-compose, build-essentials
* download the repo
* docker-compose up
* ? 
* profit

# Thanks for the oportunity
## This is not done by a long shot and I will continue even if this does not pan out, only with a bit less work during the work week
